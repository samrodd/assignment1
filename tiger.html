<h1>Tiger</h1>
<p>Tigers are an endangered species of cat - they are the largest cat species alive. Male tigers can weigh between 200 and 680 pounds and female tigers can weigh between 140 and 390 pounds. They prey on deer and boar and are considered apex predators. In other words, don't mess with tigers. Don't jump into their cages at our zoo. We're not coming in to save you. Tigers love pepper and hate cinnamon (and Joe Exotic and Roy from Siegfried and Roy). Tigers have special eyes that give you the thrill of the fight and ability to rise up to the challenge of your rival.</p>
