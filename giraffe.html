<h1>Giraffe</h1>
<p>Giraffes are tall. In fact, they are the tallest animal alive today and can be between 15 to 20 feet tall. Most of this heigh comes from their absurdly long necks. They come from Africa and are currently a vulnerable species. Giraffes live in herds that are either all male or all female. Female giraffes raise the young because apparenlty male giraffes are total deadbeats. Male giraffes will establish dominance over one another via combat using their aforementioned absurdly long necks - talk about sticking your neck out. Am I right? Or am I right? </p>
