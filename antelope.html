<h1>Antelope</h1>
<p>If you believe Neil Young, antelopes are from where the buffalo roam, where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day. In reality, Mr. Young is mistaken. Antelope are from various regions and Africa and Eurasia. Depending on the species of antelope, they can run between 25mph and 55mph and weigh up to 600 pounds. Antelopes have horns, which they shed annually and regrow. Antelopes travel in groups known as herds. In a zoo like ours, antelopes can live up to 20 years, and possibly longer. However, in the wild, the antelopes get killed by their prey way earlier. </p>
